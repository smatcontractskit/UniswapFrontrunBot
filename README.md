# UniswapFrontrunBot

ðŸ”¥ Uniswap is a cryptocurrency exchange which uses a decentralized network protocol. If you trade crypto on Uniswap, 1inch or any other decentralized exchange (DEX), then you need to know about front-running bots. Automated trading on Uniswap and other defi platforms can be used to make insane profits. In this video, I go over how to setup a front-running bot which will perform buy/sell actions automatically without having to go through the typical manual transactional methods, which will generate passive income so you can enjoy what you want in life.

ðŸš¨ EDIT: I got messages from people who didn't fund the contract enough to cover gas fees and possible burn fees. Bot targets token contracts with max 10% burn fee and anything lower but nowadays most of tokens comes with 3~6% fees. If you fund the contract with 0.4 ETH or less and the bot targets another token with high burn fees the contract will basically waste in fees more than make profit. I recommend funding the contract with around 0.5 - 1 ETH just to make sure that won't happen.
